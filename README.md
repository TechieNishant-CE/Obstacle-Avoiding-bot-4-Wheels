# Obstacle-Avoiding-bot-4-Wheels
An autonomous robot that uses sensors like ultrasonic and servomotor to identify and avoid obstacles is called a 4-wheel obstacle avoiding bot. After processing sensor data, a microcontroller directs the motors to change direction. Better stability, balance, and smooth movement on a variety of surfaces are provided by the four-wheel design.
